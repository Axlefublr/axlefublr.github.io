				<p>Vim has made a stupid design decision, and we're still eating shit many years later.</p>
<p>It prioritised mnemonics, rather than ergonomics.</p>
<p>The issue is pretty apparent: mnemonics are helpful for the first, like, <em>week</em> while you're learning vim for the first time. <br />
And then many <em>years</em> later you still end up using the same non-optimal mappings.</p>
<a href="#the-mappings" id="the-mappings" class="anchorina">
  <hr></hr>
</a>
<p>One of the most frequent things you do in a text editor, is copy. <br />
And yet it's mapped to one of the most annoying keys to press: <kbd>y</kbd>. While powered by a big stretch of a mnemonic that we just came to accept: "yank".</p>
<p>And yet <kbd>s</kbd> sits there undisturbed, in one of the most prime finger positions on the home row, doing what <code>cl</code> can also do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't get me wrong: I loved using <kbd>s</kbd>, but it is too convenient of a placement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate pressing <kbd>p</kbd> almost as much as pressing <kbd>y</kbd>. <br />
It is another example of an 😩 key used for one of the most common actions. Except, pasting is probably more common than copying.</p>
<p><kbd>o</kbd> is one of the <em>nicest</em> to press keys, yet it's there for a fairly niche action: creating a new line.</p>
<p>What I find myself doing the most after creating a new line, is to create <em>another</em> line. <br />
Because <kbd>o</kbd> puts you into insert mode, the natural way to create another line is by pressing enter. <br />
Yet, the hand motion of switching from <kbd>o</kbd> to <kbd>Enter</kbd> is pretty cumbersome.</p>
<p>What is the most common usecase for <kbd>A</kbd>? <br />
In my experience, it's to add in a <code>;</code> or a <code>,</code>. <br />
However, if you correctly use both shifts, the hand movement to do an action like this is a bit too ridiculous: for such a <em>common</em> usecase, having to move your pinky <em>aaaaallllll</em> the way from the right shift to <code>;</code> ends up compiling into an annoyance.</p>
<p>The choice of <kbd>a</kbd> is also strange in a different way. <br />
To insert at the <em>left</em> of the cursor, you press the <em>right</em> key (<kbd>i</kbd>). To insert at the <em>right</em> of the cursor, you press the <em>left</em> key (<kbd>a</kbd>). <br />
???</p>
<h1 id="you-can-stop-eating-shit"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#you-can-stop-eating-shit" aria-label="Anchor link for: you-can-stop-eating-shit">you can stop eating shit</a></h1>
<p>Defaults are made to be CHANGED from. <br />
It's great when they are good to begin with, but that's not always the case. <br />
Do not be afraid of <em>change</em> when it can provide you a much nicer experience.</p>
<p>My copy key is now <kbd>s</kbd>. <br />
What's the mnemonic? "Steal"? <br />
Wrong question. I don't <em>need</em> a mnemonic! If the mapping <em>feels</em> right, your muscle memory adjusts pretty quick!</p>
<p>Now I don't have to travel across the Alps just to copy something: the key is on my home row.</p>
<p>My paste key is <kbd>o</kbd>. <br />
<em>Much</em> nicer to press than <kbd>p</kbd>! And in addition, something like <code>yyp</code> is now <code>sso</code>, which I find to simply be much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Insert new line is now on <kbd>a</kbd>. <br />
Now when I insert a new line, the motion of my right hand to reach <kbd>Enter</kbd> is much smoother! <br />
Smoother even if I do "insert new line above" (<kbd>A</kbd>) first; all I need to do is slightly move the right pinky from right shift to <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
<p>Insert <em>after</em> the cursor is on <kbd>p</kbd>. <br />
This was risky in my head, because I don't <em>like</em> pressing <kbd>p</kbd>. But very quickly I realized just how much nicer it is than <kbd>a</kbd> for the purpose.</p>
<p>First of all, it <em>is</em> on the right side of <kbd>i</kbd>! So, <kbd>i</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> now play along with a consistent semantic of "this one is on the left, this means <em>before</em>" and "this one is on the right, this means <em>after</em>".</p>
<p>But even better than that, appending is AMAZING now! <br />
The hand movement to append a <code>;</code> or <code>,</code> at the end of the line is way smaller now, and feels really comfortable. <br />
Also generally, pressing right shift is more difficult than pressing <em>left</em> shift anyway; so overall there's less hand movement for something that I do really frequently, especially while writing a blog post for example.</p>

</a>
<p>After changing these, it took me <em>maybe</em> two days to get used to the new mappings. This is simply because of how much more <em>fitting</em> they feel in my head, and to my fingers.</p>
<p>You will have your own gripes that you will solve differently than me, but I wanted to shed light on that it <em>can</em> be <strong>really</strong> beneficial to change defaults, even when they are as strong-rooted as the ones I listed.</p>
<p>It's true: a lot of <em>other</em> programs will replicate vim, and have semantically fitting <code>hjkl</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>p</code>, etc mappings. <br />
What do you do about that?</p>
<p>Personally, I just context switch, or reconfigure the mappings.
This may seem like a lot of effort, or a non-ideal solution, but look at it from a different lens: why <em>would</em> you sacrifice your experience in the place where you spend most of your time (your editor), just for some <em>other</em> program to feel consistent?</p>
<p>I do agree, context switching is annoying, but can be learned: if you have a strong thought of "this is a different program", you can eventually stop caring that its mappings are inconsistent with what you remapped.
Or, you know, remap them in that program as well.</p>
