I'm unfortunately in russia. \
Since the start of the war, most services have left the country, now requiring a vpn to use.

But funny thing ‚Äî so did the *vpns*!

First, some now required a vpn to access them (the another vpn). \
Sounds pretty useless, but I could conceivably use some bad free vpn to then enable the good one, disconnect the free one and continue using the good one until I reboot. \
So that worked to an extent, but it didn't last that long. \
One by one, vpns started massively throttling, taking tens of minutes to connect, and eventually just not connecting at all. \
Express, Nord, Air, Surfshark, CyberGhost, Private Internet Access, Proton, Windscribe, Mullvad ‚Äî are all vpns I've used or tried using, until ultimately they ***all*** broke.

I'm in quite a salted vegetable here, I certainly need to access things like discord, youtube, spotify, and most of the internet honestly; what do I do?

# the name of this heading would be a spoiler to the dramatic tension of the previous sentence

VPNs are not the first technology that allows you to avoid geo-restrictions. \
Thanks to my friend's effortful history lesson on networking, I got a better idea of what a *proxy* is. \
Better enough to now consider it as a possible solution.

A proxy, in my understanding, is a server that can make requests *for you*. \
It's exactly like sexism actually:{{fn(i=1)}} you, the russian woman, saying something to another server is rejected. \
So you ask a man (the proxy) to say the same thing *for you*, and give you the response ‚Äî now it suddenly works.

VPNs often work globally on your system which is very convenient,
but you do tend to *need* geo-restriction-unlocking for only a few places. \
Those few places, usually, allow you to configure the proxy!

There are HTTP proxies you can find out there for free, but really shouldn't:
the S part of HTTPS is very important for the *security* of your data, as without TLS,
the data you send will be visible to the proxy itself ‚Äî a bank password that you enter, for example. \
Finding free HTTP*S* proxies is then a *privacy* concern, so I decided to *buy* one instead.

# for the russians

In this section I'll go over my exact process for buying a proxy, \
but if you're not russian you're better off using some store that's not specifically tailored to russians. \
Google for ‚Äúbuy https proxy‚Äù and you'll probably get there.

Although, I'd recommend actually going through with my suggestions in the blog post, after you've completed it ‚Äî I will be omitting some things until later notice for dramatic effect.

As a hilarious way to force non-russian readers to skip this section, I'll write it *in* russian.

You have an https proxy now! \
The proxy comes with a set of ‚Äúinformation‚Äù that you're going to use to plug it into places. \
Let's name all of them, so that they're a bit more familiar!{{fn(i=4)}}

|thingy|namey|
|------|-----|
|162.3.164.178|ip address|
|8676|port|
|user223767|username|
|eIwB7xB|password|

The ip address + port are probably discoverable enough{{fn(i=5)}} where someone unwanted could get access to your proxy, so it will usually come with a username and password as well. \
You are meant to keep these secret üòº

A lot of places that let you configure a proxy, simply have separate fields for each of the 4 values. \
But some don't!

The following syntax is something you might see yourself using in those other places:
```
user223767:eIwB7xB@162.3.164.178:8676
```
i.e.
```
username:password@ip:port
```

It's rare to use them bare like this though, usually you're expected to give a link:
```
https://user223767:eIwB7xB@162.3.164.178:8676
https://username:password@ip:port
```

# ok ok let's use this proxy, let's use this proxy in our apps

The main, and almost *only* place where I need georestriction unlocking, is my browser. \
Through some steps (that I'll teach you later), I was successfully able to use my new proxy, \
and no longer needed to jump through 5 free vpns :D

It seemed surprisingly straightforward, and continued working for a while, until I switched to [floorp](/content/floorp/index.md). \
In firefox, everything worked just how you'd expect. \
But on floorp, suddenly, youtube videos were not playing ü§î

Note, the entire rest of the website was working, just not actual playback. \
At the time, this put me into anxiety mode; I was considoring{{fn(i=6)}} using firefox specifically for youtube, but that sounded like quite a shitty tradeoff. \
Firefox and floorp handle proxies differently *somehow*.
I wasn't quite sure why yet.

My favorite puppy{{fn(i=7)}} helped me solve this, with some bespoke setup that involved its VPS' socks4 proxy. \
Still not exactly sure what all this is, but now I'm hearing this üß¶ term when it comes to proxies. Interesting.

So at that point, I was paying for my own proxy to use for most things, and using my partner's socks4 proxy for youtube. \
Feels kinda bleghy, right? \
Shouldn't my own proxy already accomplish everything?

I realized my grave underunderstanding recently, while trying to set up discord. \
*Web* discord is just fine for me, but is crucially missing the ctrl+123456789 hotkeys, so I really wanted to try out vesktop to get those. \
Both fortunately and unfortunately, *there* the proxy setup was more difficult to figure out. \
As I was trying different things, I came across a new nugget of knowlege: \
‚Äúhttps proxies are solid for TCP, but fucky for UDP. socks5 solves this though‚Äù

Through my friend's networking history lesson, I got a slightly better idea of what TCP and UDP are usually used for. \
And UDP, crucially, is used for *video playback*, among other things!

Huh! The exact thing that's *not* working off of my proxy in floorp. \
Hmmm‚Ä¶ So if I had a socks5 proxy, this might get solved?

I was playing around in my proxys.io (where I bought my proxy) account, and happened to enter into the proxy's information page again. \
I discovered a new field, that I never understood or paid attention to before: ‚Äúsocks5 port‚Äù.

Well holy shit! \
Does this mean that my proxy is a socks5 proxy *too*, rather than only https?

I reconfigure the proxy in my browser to use socks5 instead of https, and provide the new port. \
I restart my browser and rush into youtube, to be completely dumbfounded by seeing that ***it works***.

Hoooooooly fucking shit I was paying for this proxy for more than half a year at this point, and all I fucking needed to do was realize that socks5 is a level up from https, rather than being some fancy other type,
and that it's simply something I should be using everywhere I can,
to make more things work more easily.

‚ùówait my proxy supports socks5??

‚ùófirefox proxy config
‚ùóah wait, socks5 ‚Äî and that's why I told you to read the blog first before buying the proxy, so you could check for socks5

‚ùóhmmm I guess only http, so partner's workaround after floorp switch
‚ùótry to discord, ah right needs proxy, wait how do I pass it, oh maybe socks5, oh how about this flag
‚ùóhence privoxy

‚ùóbut whoops, I guess they don't support wtype

‚ùódrony setup ‚Äî wifi and not wifi, but otherwise very straightforward, make sure to use the socks5 thing
‚ùósharing the proxy with a friend now so the setup seems to be reproducible :D
