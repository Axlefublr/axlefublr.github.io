In my blogs, you may see an unreasonably high count of headings. \
I like them so much nowadays due to their practical value: \
if you click on a heading, it becomes part of your current URL and scrolls to be at the top of the viewport. \
Now if you accidentally reload the page, the heading anchor will act as a "checkpoint", when otherwise you'd be scrolled all the way to the top.
