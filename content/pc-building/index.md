The last nemesis of my [pc noise war](@/journey-of-noise/index.md) has been the PSU. \
For quiiite a few months now, actually! \
And a couple of days ago, it has finally been defeated 😌 \
But *this* journey wasn't straightforward either!

# the fool is not one who fools around, or are they?

I've touched my computer quite a lot at this point.
I figured out, by pure wit, how to disable the led on the front panel, and removed the appropriate connector.
I have switched out my gpu, and even made my own cooling solution for it, to reduce noise. \
This and a few other minor things raised my familiarity with pc building, but I am ultimately still afraid.

A fool thinks that everything always is going to work out magically, a sage understands the limits of their knowledge. \
I'm no sage but pc building is very caveaty — so instead of buying the new PSU I've been wanting for so long and installing it myself, I decided to hire a technician to help me with the entire process.

First, they'd arrive and inspect my computer, to check if the psu that I have in mind would fit. \
I don't mean just physically, mind you: are the connectors compatible with my whatever? are there enough watts for all my components? and crucially, might there be any other issues that I don't even know exist?

Once I get this sanity check confirmed, I'd then order the psu, wait for it to arrive, and hire the technician yet again to replace my current psu with this new one.

If you've built a computer before, or otherwise have knowledge in this subject, you might know that the *psu* is nothing to worry about — nothing to hire a technician for, really. \
But I didn't know at the time, and in a quite roundabouty way ended up actually being correct about the worry.
You'll see why in a bit :3

# be...loud?

One thing I knew for quite sure is that I wanted my psu from the company “bequiet”. \
As the name suggests, they specialize on effectively silent power supplies, and that plays into my desires of deafness really well. \
I looked around for a bequiet psu on the russian facebook marketplace equivalent (avito), and found *some* that *seemed*{{fn(i=1)}} to fit the bill. \
“System Power 9 750W” might as well be random gibberish to me, but that's part of what the technician is for.

He arrives and I explain what I want from him: check if *my suggestion* is a correct choice and I'm not going for something stupid. Tell me if “ah actually the thingymabop is version 3.2 and so if you plug this in the sun will explode” — usual tech stuff that is not unreasonable to expect, but is a mystery to me. \
I made a **very** clear lean towards the choice that I already knew I wanted; sure, I would be buying used, but a GREAT psu for half the price. Maybe even less!

The technician seemed to half ignore my pick, and went to go look for a psu on his phone. \
He found a *new* psu at essentially the same exact price as the one that I picked. \
Me: “the bequiet one is known to be very quiet though, will *this* one also be?” \
The Devil: “I mean yeah of course, look at the specs it says ‘quiet operation’”

Huh! :o \
An also quiet psu, at effectively the same price, but bought *new* so I have warranty, ***and*** I get to get it installed *today*? Sign me up! That sounds great! \
I guess that's why I pay for a technician 🗣️ my goat gave me a much better solution that I didn't even think of going for :D

*Surely that's not foreshadowing*

# it is

Now that we've decided on the psu, I guess I go and buy it, then call the technician again so he can come and install it? 🤔 that sounds about right.. \
But no! My goat in here once again making things so *simple* — he was chill to simply go and buy it himself (with my money naturally), come back and install it in one fell swoop. How convenient!

Once he comes back and gets to installing the new psu, he complains about the state of my computer, as any technician seems to like to do :p \
Alright man whatever you say. Slay king I guess. \
“Woahhhh your gpu is FUCKED actually, thank god you hired me cause without me it'd only work for a *lil* bit more and die soon after” — really! I'm not sure why you're looking at my gpu actually I thought I hired you to install the psu? I mean alright you can tinker if you want. \
“Danggggg the thermal paste on your cpu is shriveled! You must be overheating all the time, right?” — nah not really, my temperatures are stellar but yeah I didn't realize it was that bad, good catch.

He does some other housekeeping that once again I didn't hire him to do, but on the spot I forgot to realize the clash. \
See, the previous day I called them to get a price of how much the two visits would cost. One would be the psu recommendation based on a check of my computer, and the second would be the replacement/installation. \
I now have a price in mind, that I'm expecting to pay, and it's sitting in my head so strongly that I neglect to notice the devil's grabby hands. \
He seems so eager, but I don't realize it's because he's going to *charge me* for all this extra work that I never intended for him to do, even if it's warranted.

Some overall cleaning and blowing out the dust I could've done myself, it was just not that dirty yet so I didn't care. \
Changing the thermal paste on the cpu and gpu I could've easily done myself, it's just that the thermals are so good that I haven't found a need. \
Changing the thermal *pads* on the graphics card I don't actually know how to do but once again it's been working *fantastically*, so I find the “it'd only work for a *lil* bit more” exclamation quite hard to believe.

In the end of it all, I end up staring at a 80$ bill. *Excluding* the price of the psu. \
Wh.. what?

The price is so heart dropping{{fn(i=2)}} that I completely skipped the emotion. It was so obscenely too much, for work I DID NOT ASK FOR, that in horror I close my soul from feeling anything about the situation.

Soon after I try to rationalize the amount, but it really doesn't work no matter how I rotate it. \
The initial idea is to make sure I don't fuck up with the psu, right?
Well, I could have fucked up the psu, motherboard, *and* cpu and it'd cost about as much as this service.
So it is just really obscene no matter how I spin it.

The best I can squeeze is that “well at least the thermal paste is great and temperatures are even lower now?” but later on even this was no longer a value. You'll see.

# afterphysics

Well, this sucks, but I'm not dumb enough to be upgrading while in a financial hole: I had some money I could spend, and I could overspend and still be okay. I planned for this, despite it still feeling quite bad.

Now I should have finally solved the long standing psu noise issue :D \
Here we go, silent computer!!

...I mean.. it *is* quieter... I think? \
Hmmm... And it trembles in a bit of a strange way? No hum anymore though! \
This *is* an upgrade, but I expected a bigger drop in volume levels, you know?

I guess the dream scenario of an actually *silent* computer is not really a thing.
You know how various tech channels like to go “wow this computer is so quiet!”?
They probably mean *in comparison* to other, louder computers; while the “quiet” pc is still very much audible. \
I don't really have a frame of reference — this is my first pc (rather than laptop), so I didn't really have much of a way to know.

I still feel accomplished by the upgrade despite all this, and go tell my partner about it. \
“I finally upgraded my psu 🥳 It's a Deepcool PF650 650W” \
“OH NOOOOOOOOO” \
“Well surely you're overreacting sweetie, what's so bad about it?” \
“It's an infamously awful model, with all sorts of stability issues” \
“Meh, not worth returning and replacing for that”

What it told me next hit me like a brick: \
“I cannot hear *my* power supply ***even when I'm overwhelmed***”

Hoooooly shit... \
So I'm not crazy?? PSUs *can* genuinely be really quiet? Cause I can fucking certainly hear this one loud and clear when I'm just whelmed, forget about over. \
Alright, I'm conviced — it is now my plan to return this psu and order an actual bequiet psu, like I originally intended to.

So wait, the devil is even worse now! Aside from the insane scam of a price, bro literally diverted me away from a much better option that ***I*** the client made, into an INFAMOUSLY SHITTY option that he the “professional” decided on, on the spot. Fuckhat. Die of all cancers.

# fuck it we ball

The above happened over a couple of days, in which I actually also ordered a better cpu and gpu as well! \
That is, *after* having the new psu installed. See, mr. devil, I wasn't even sure at that point if I wanted to keep using those cpu + gpu, so obviously I wouldn't pay for their maintenance — if they suddenly broke I would simply decidedly order new ones, which I ended up doing anyway.
But he never fucking asked — just a blind assumption that I need to have *this* computer with *these* components working *at any cost*. No, bitch, I want the psu replaced that's literally it.

And now that I'm deciding to return it, I effectively have spent 80$ (+ my valuable fucking time and emotional state) for LITERALLY no benefit. \
Now me spending an entire 15$ on kinder eggs when I was 12 doesn't sound like that bad of a misuse of money{{fn(i=3)}} anymore.

Ideally, I'd just wait for the cpu, gpu, and the bequiet psu to all arrive, and at that point hire a technician from a different company to *help* me assemble it. While very strictly ensuring I know the price ahead of time!! \
But unfortunately all of them would arrive *after* the date at which I can still return the psu. \
So sooner or later, I'll still have to switch the deepcool psu for my old one in the meantime.

I'm not gonna pay a technician to do this replacement again because honestly it'd feel too bad.
Essentially paying to come back to the status quo would make me feel even worse about the insane 80$.
This time, I plan to do it myself!

Now, since I'm still a bit scared, it'd make sense to wait until prior to the final day of return, to switch out the psu. \
But I can't shake off the feeling that the universe will punish me in some way for intentionally holding out with the psu that I intend to return anyway: I'm consuming value while not intending to pay for it, basically. \
The return warranty of 14 days is fairly solid in russia; it has helped me out quite a few times now.
It *should* be trustworthy, but sometimes life can fuck you over in unexpected but somehow valid ways: if I try to abuse the return period by waiting, suddenly when I actually get to the return process, ***something*** will come up.

“Oh actually for this type of product there's x and y and z and so you can't return it anymore. You could within 5 days though. Oh and obviously this is common knowledge that you're stupid for not knowing.” \
Idk, this sorta thing happened to me a bit too many times. Research surprisingly doesn't help.

# dual channel

I felt additionally motivated because there's actually *yet another* upgrade I decided to do in the meantime.

I have 12 gb of ram. It is more than plenty I'd say, but I *do* get weird OOM crashes every so often. \
Then, how do we comprise 12 gb of ram, considering it's all in powers of 2? \
You take 4+2+4+2, filling out the 4 ram sticks.

Now, that's not *awful* necessarily but it's kinda bad still. It's better to fill the first and third (or second and fourth) slots only, with higher capacity sticks, than fill out all of them with lower capacity. \
6 gb sticks are not a thing, so I'll go for 2 sticks of 8 gb.

The idea stuck out to me because back when I had a laptop (rip), I remember upgrading the ram in it and it being *surprisingly* cheap. \
I go and check on the used market: turns out it's even dirter cheaper! Just 8$ for 2 sticks of ddr3 ram. Wonderful! \
Compared to the insane spend before, this might as well be a free upgrade, so I might as well do it.

# moment of lie

“Installing ram is easy” I reasonably thought. \
But as often things that you're inexperienced in are, it turned out to be a lot more tricky!

Pulling out my old ram was ridiculously difficult. It took wayyyy more force than I thought! \
Matter of fact, I ended up trying to pull it out with tweezers, until I realized what the fuck I was doing in that moment and stopped myself. \
I was trying my hardest to keep the ram completely straight while pulling it out, while turns out a *slight* wiggle is actually okay — *then* it became laughably easy.

In this whole process I removed the cpu cooler{{fn(i=4)}} and gpu, to give me more space to work with the ram. \
That's quite a chunk of the work I'd do when replacing the PSU later, so I thought I might as well do it in one go.

I *did* plan to wait for a *bit* longer initially (to tempt fate), so that I wouldn't have to wait an entire week or more for a working computer, in the worst case, but I guess I just couldn't wait to get the return off my chest.

Unplugging the psu connectors was even more difficult than the ram. \
I was already acquainted with the game of my gpu and how damn difficult it is to unplug the connectors on it, but the 24-pin motherboard connector was a whole different beast! No tweezers this time, though.
I unplug everything, remove the deepcool psu; screw back in the old psu{{fn(i=5)}} and plug everything back in.

Moment of truth...

Forget about turning on, the fucking diagnostic light on my motherboard is no longer working??
No fan spin no nothing. \
I distinctly remember that when my motherboard is connected to power, it shines a green light.
It straight up noping out is a sign that something is horribly wrong. \
Considering I *did* check all the connectors again, as well as the nefarious psu power switch.
Even checked if I had electricity in my home at the time, lol!
I think *this* warrants a technician{{fn(i=6)}}.

# the angel

I don't think I did anything too stupid, but I'm clearly missing something; something that will be obvious to a professional FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY.

He arrives and checks everything. First the obvious steps, then whatever the fuck else he was trying. Bro was fighting for my computer for a good hour I think?

His interesting discovery is that my motherboard socket actually had bent pins! \
I quite specifically did not take out the cpu in these 2-3 hours, prior to which the computer was fully working.
So I'm really confused as to **how** these pins could have bent in that timeframe{{fn(i=7)}}.

He asks me for a needle to try to straighten them out, and actually gets the motherboard to spin the fans! Okay 💗 Yay 💗 \
Buuuut there's no image, still.
We tried both the old and the new ram, so that isn't the issue either.
Yeahhh, the motherboard is done for good — or more so, it would be more expensive to fix than to just buy another one. \
The wait time is going to be about as predicted, and quite painful 😭, but less painful than paying for repairs.

Finally, someone who didn't decide *for me* that I want this motherboard to work at all cost! \
Although at the end I still have a broken computer, I now feel **certain** that buying another motherboard is actually the correct play, rather than a rushed half baked decision.
That in itself is worth something!

He did quite a lot of work though, I wonder how much I'm gonna be charged... \
And so, the angel proclaims: “10$”

“Wh..wh.WHAT?? THAT'S SO CHEAP!” \
“The pc doesn't work, so in my book more money would be undeserved”

Dude. Wow! In real life that sounded like a fucking movie quote he said it so epicly. \
Now *that's* a technician!

With pricing so reasonable, I have a neat plan of safety: when *all* my new components arrive, I'll hire this same guy to help me assemble the pc. \
Despite all the pain, I still find pc building fascinating and interesting, so I want to learn to do it the right way.
I really don't wanna risk another week of waiting for a component, so having a professional watch me, and possibly prevent inexperienced mistakes of mine, sounds like a great idea.

As an extra precaution, I made myself a promise: ***all*** the components. \
If the new motherboard comes before everything else, I *could* conceivably hire him *then*, and then do the other components on my own as they come. \
But no, I learned my lesson — patience brings better results, and so I'll shit my pants before I get to building the refurbished pc without surveillance. \
This time, I'll **ensure** a working computer, for a reasonable price. Fuck you, universe! You won't fuck me over if I'm *that* diligent!

I asked for a price on that idea pretty immediately, and amazingly it's the same price as him just building the computer himself! \
As an ex helper, I know that teaching someone is more, sometimes a *lot* more effort than just doing the thing yourself.
So equal pricing is actually a relief 😌

# deading around

Welp, my computer is broken for about a week.
You know what that means? I'm gonna watch even MORE [Baalorlord](https://www.youtube.com/@Baalorlord/videos) 😈

{{video(path="baalorlord")}}

(genuinely a good 95% of all content that I watch nowadays is just this guy)

But aside from the initial megawatch of doom, I now have a lot of time to consume content on *pc building*, and learn the process ahead of time! \
Better yet, since I'm switching out basically all of my components anyway, I get to safely practice on the broken computer :D

One of the scarier parts of building a pc is of course installing the cpu. \
Yeah yeah I know: “it's gonna be fine as long as you're not *careless*, you don't need to be incredibly skillful at it”, but still it's quite a thrill. \
Since my motherboard is broken *anyway*, I might as well practice inserting and outserting the cpu: if I happen to bend a pin in one of those attempts, I'll be able to learn what *not* to do very precisely, for free! Yay?

I outtake (mhm definitely the right word for this) the cpu for the first time, and glare at the motherboard pins.
Hold up, there is still a bent pin?

I was under the assumption that the technician fixed that 🤔 but maybe he touched on the pin that looked salvageable, and didn't bother touching this more difficult looking one? Neither will I 😌 \
I continue practicing: removing and adding back the ram (no pliers), attaching front panel cables, doing cable management, mounting the motherboard onto the case.

I'm missing a standoff, so I stare at where I can put them for the best stability.
Hmmm... I have only 6 holes in my motherboard, for standoffs; that seems a bit suspicious.
And the case only mentions mini-ATX and micro-ATX, skipping to show where the normal-ATX placement is. Haha what a silly case! \
Right? Wait, did I have a micro-ATX case this entire time?

I go and check the motherboard that I ordered: it is very clearly longer. Considering that this old motherboard *juuuust* fits, the new one absolutely wouldn't.
Whoops! Ordered an ATX motherboard for a micro-ATX case :> \
Well then, I guess I'm buying a new **case** too :D

This new sudden requirement I'm actually not at all sad about: I get to finally have *all* the screws and the better airflow I've been wanting for a while :3 \
But what this also means, is that I've officially replaced *all* of my components (rendering that 80$ COMPLETELY useless), except the SSD.

Naturally, next I thought about upgrading the SSD as well, but neither managing two drives nor reinstalling the distro sounds fun.
Here's a table of all of my upgrades!
|Component|Old|New|
|---------|---|---|
|gpu|AMD Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ 4gb Sapphire OC|AMD Radeon RX 6600 Fighter 8gb PowerColor|
|cpu|Intel Core i5-4670|Intel Core i7-4790K|
|motherboard|ASUS B85-PLUS/USB 3.1|Gigаbytе GA-P85-D3 r2.0|
|power supply|only god knows|bequiet Pure Power 11 600W|
|case|no clue|Ocyprus Gamma C60|

# finally, silence

I'm on my new computer now, and it is ***actually*** silent. \
And I don't mean “oh it's so quiet, I don't hear it while I'm in headphones” — NO!
I mean that if I put my ear right next to the case, I hear NOTHING. \
So this *is* achievable :D

As promised, I hired the guy to help me assemble the pc. \
Well okay that's a slight lie; I couldn't wait for that exact guy to reply so I hired someone else from the same company.

I like the safety, but all these days of learning pc building made me quite confident and knowledgeable about the process.
The guy *was* helpful here and there, but I realize that *now* I could have built the pc entirely myself. \
But the immediately *working* computer next to me makes me feel iffy to think hiring him was wasteful; I'd feel **very** different if suddenly the computer *didn't* end up working for one reason or another.

So, no regrets finally; but my next computer will be built by just me 😌

# they can be this good?

In my previous setup, I removed the default fans off the gpu and zip tied my “Arctic Cooling P12 PWM PST CO”s onto it. \
Plugged them into the CHA fan port, and had them spin depending on the gpu's temperature, using `fancontrol`.

Doing that was a pretty massive improvement in noise levels, so I was intending to do the same shtick with my new gpu. \
Ngl I couldn't figure out how to detach the fan holding plastic thingymabop off of it, so I put the task in the backburner. \
“I'll probably hear it somewhat but it shouldn't be unbearable”

The bears were *suspicious*. \
I couldn't hear it... At all?

I check the fans of the gpu and they aren't spinning at all.
Cool! So they only start at some higher temperature, that's really nice :D \
But once they start, they're probably pretty loud right?

❗gpu only starts spinning at 70 and it's really damn hard to get it to be that hot; tried on repeat benchmarking and still couldn't get it there

#

Previously I set my fans to be constantly on, at their lowest possible speed, when the temperature is below the minimum. \
The PSU was so loud that I genuinely could not tell a difference in the noise levels of fans at lowest speed vs fans completely off 🤷‍♀️

But now? The fans are the *only* things that make sound in my computer

❗AVERAGE is a new knob; I discovered that trying to go for many samples with bigger average is a noob trap bc makes the fans start stoppy. while 10 seconds sample time and average of 2 still responds fast enough, isn't fooled by spikes, and effectively makes fans spin for at least 10 seconds — it's the equivalent of MINTIME which I wish existed

❗I don't need to have maxpwm to 255, a lot less is plenty; although interestingly my cha fans are unable to start spinning if I set a low enough maxpwm, for some reason
❗try to daisy chain all on cpu header for consistency, but strange crackle: removed when on their own header agin
❗but tradeoff: need higher min pwm to actually consistently start both

# footnotes

{{hn(i=1)}} Semt? lol

{{hn(i=2)}} Keep in mind that it's russia pricing. I say 80$ I mean 8000₽.

{{hn(i=3)}} *That* situation is even sadder cause my goal was more so the toys inside of them rather than the really fricking tasty chocolate. I think it's to the point that I threw some of the chocolate away??? Pretty insane, I still remember that situation in pain.

{{hn(i=4)}} Notably I didn't pull out the actual cpu. And also it's an LGA 1150 Intel processor, which is held in place really tightly and cannot be yanked out when removing the cooler, unlike AM4 AMD cpus can be. You can remember this for later.

{{hn(i=5)}} This tidbit doesn't really fit into the flow of the blog post but is still kinda relevant.
There is another concern, aside from noise, because of which I wanted to upgrade my PSU — it was missing the +2 connectors for the gpu! \
I was powering my gpu, which expects 8+6, with 6+6 :> \
This is *fine* (I don't risk my components), as it's asking for a lot less power than the pcie slot + 6+6 provide, but I *did* experience crashes every so often. \
In games, I needed to optimize not only for fps+beauty, but also power consumption! \
And, well, this does still feel quite scuffed :p

While replugging my old psu, I realized that it *did*, **this entire time**, have the +2 connectors 😭 \
I was just too scared to look for them!

{{hn(i=6)}} I hope you see now why my initial idea to hire a technician to do something as simple as replacing the psu, *wasn't* that crazy — after all, I **did** end up fucking it up!

{{hn(i=7)}} You might now reasonably suspect this technician, but I don't think he's at fault here: my motherboard was already not working before he came, after all.
