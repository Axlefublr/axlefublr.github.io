Shaving is a massive hassle. Because I'm trans, it's even hassler for me than to the average person.

Elecric shavers are pretty low effort, but they also don't cut that close to the skin, so it's a good strategy to use when you have a lot of hair, but pretty ass if you don't.

Normal razors have their own plethora of issues. They may cut you, "dribble" on the skin, introduce ingrown hairs, overall feel too rough and damage your skin. \
You can pick your razor to have more blades to mitigate some of these issues, but then the problem is the sheer price.

I'm broke as hell! I can't replace the blade as often as it's recommended, so I end up with a shitty razor for most of the time. If I go for a cheaper blade, I just *start* with a shitty one, lol.

Shaving sucks, doesn't it!

It's the thought that I accepted for the longest time. But just recently, my friend recommended me something that made me *want* to shave again. Over the past couple of days, I shaved my entire body. This barely ever happens! It's so fun now!

# safety razors

This product name sounded strangely vague to me!

A safety razor is basically a holder for the classic razor blades (image below). I had no clue what they were used for before!

Here's how a safety razor looks:

It takes a razor blade, and bends it to give you two bladed sides that you can use to shave with.
