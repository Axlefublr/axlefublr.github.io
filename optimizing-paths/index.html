				<p>The default paths that you start with, and the paths you might end up creating naturally, can be quite inconvenient to work with.</p>
<p>In your home directory, you probably have <code>Documents</code>, <code>Downloads</code>, <code>Pictures</code>, <code>Videos</code>, etc. <br />
To follow the semantic, you might create directories like <code>Programming</code>, <code>Notes</code>, and the like. <br />
All of them are pretty long words, and annoyingly they all start with an uppercase letter: neither of that helps if you need to type out full paths to things pretty often.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do: my biggest usecase is <a rel="noopener external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Axlefublr/dotfiles/blob/main/eli/setup/dode.fish">how I handle program setups</a>, but typing out paths comes up in all sorts of places. <br />
<code>~/Programming/Projects/Mine/Rust/2025</code> quickly becomes up exhausting to type in, over time. <br />
Tab completing paths <em>helps</em>, but has other issues that I'll go over in another upcoming blog post<a href="#footnote-1" id="headnote-1" class="footnote" title="You'll be able to jump back here painlessly.">
  <sup>1</sup>
</a>
.</p>
<p>To minimize effort of typing in paths, as well as travelling to such paths, some time ago I renamed most of my directory structure to all be single characters, basically. Look at the tree below:</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #D4BE98; background-color: #00000000;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>~</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  r</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    forks</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    proj</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    binaries</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    backup</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    info</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  i</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    tools</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    e</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>      memes</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>      themes</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>      logos</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>      icons</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    s</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>      screenshot1.png</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>      screenshot2.png</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>      screenvideo.mp4</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  q</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    torrent.torrent</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  w</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    random-download.jpeg</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The core directories, that I'll be typing in the most often, are all single characters. But deeper directories are named normally.</p>
<p>This worked pretty well! Now to get to my screenshots directory, I simply need to type out <code>~/i/s</code>, rather than <code>~/Pictures/screenshots</code><a href="#footnote-2" id="headnote-2" class="footnote" title="You'll be able to jump back here painlessly.">
  <sup>2</sup>
</a>
.
But there are two things that this approach misses.</p>
<p>First, it's ugly. <br />
Seeing <code>~/r/proj/harp</code> in my prompt just feels kinda bad :/ <br />
It's extra uglified by the fact that the core directories <em>are</em> single letters, but deeper directories aren't, so the path ends up looking unbalanced.</p>
<p>Second, it's a massive pain for search for. <br />
If you want to look for <code>Pictures</code>, you might need to filter out the normal word “pictures”, sure, but ultimately you're still narrowing things down somewhat. <br />
But searching for <code>i</code>…</p>
<p>I can do <code>i/</code>, but then I'm making the assumption that I immediately refer to another path fragment that is in <code>i</code>. <br />
I could <code>/i</code>, but then I'm possibly missing myself programmatically appending the path <code>i</code> to my home directory (think <code>home_dir + "i"</code>). <br />
<code>\bi\b</code> will show me way too many results.</p>
<p>So no matter how I search, I either have to filter through too many things, or I possibly miss some cases where I <em>do</em> still use the path I want to search for.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'm not doing zoxide any favors. <br />
The core directories might as well be impossible to zoxide to, since their queries would be so non-unique; but they're short specifically so that I <em>don't have to</em> use zoxide to get to them, to be fair. <br />
But then the deeper directories come back to being normal, common words, so zoxiding to them is <em>also</em> a pain, just of a different genre.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I decided to take on the grueling task of renaming and restructuring directories in my <code>~</code>, to handle all of my concerns.</p>
<p>I had multiple requirements for the new names:</p>
<ol>
<li>Has to be a short name, but more than 2 characters. <br />
It will still be fast and easy to type in, while not looking too unbalanced and ugly.</li>
<li>Has to be gibberish. <br />
Making it way easier to search for precisely, and making it ideal for zoxide, as a nice side bonus.</li>
<li>Has to <em>feel</em> nice to type in. <br />
Following the point that paths are something I'll be typing out again and again in the future, I should have a comfortable time doing so.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the tree that I ended up with:</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #D4BE98; background-color: #00000000;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>~</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  fes</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    ack</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    bin</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    dot</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    eli</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    foe</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    lai</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    ork</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    wks</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  go</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  iwm</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    dls</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    lwkc</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    msk</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    osl</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    rnt</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    sco</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    tox</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    twemoji</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    vdi</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  wlx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, almost all of the directories are complete gibberish. Except go I guess. They really couldn't've made it <code>.go</code> instead 🙄 <br />
I sat down, and naturally followed where my fingers like to go after typing each letter. <br />
After I type <code>f</code>, what letter feels nice to type in next? <br />
Then, I considered what directories are going to come after which directories.</p>
<p><code>fes</code>, for example, will be coming after typing in <code>~/</code>; both ~ and / are on the right side of the keyboard (for me), so that's why <code>fes</code> is so left-focused. <br />
All the directories inside of <code>fes</code> will come after <code>fes</code>, obviously, so now I optimize their names according to that. <br />
After a heavy left-side, I now introduce the right side keys quite a bit more.</p>
<p>I figured out what felt good by repetitively typing in the full path to the directory, and feeling it out. <br />
For example, <code>fes</code> was first <code>int</code>!<a href="#footnote-3" id="headnote-3" class="footnote" title="You'll be able to jump back here painlessly.">
  <sup>3</sup>
</a>
 <br />
But after typing it out a bunch of times, I noticed that pressing <code>n</code> so close after <code>~/</code> simply didn't feel that good; which is a big nono for such a core, commonly typed directory. Additionally, <code>int</code> is a real thing that may come up in searches, as a false positive, so that's another reason to not use it.</p>
<p>After making the highest level directories, I went on to rename a bunch of directories inside of there. Look at a tree again, but now with context of how the directory used to be called.</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #D4BE98; background-color: #00000000;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>~</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  fes &lt;- r</span></span>

<span class="giallo-l"><span>    lai &lt;- proj</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    ork &lt;- forks</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    wks &lt;- wks, actually. this one hasn&#39;t changed</span></span>

<span class="giallo-l"><span>    lwkc    &lt;- we don&#39;t talk about this one</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    msk     &lt;- mus</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    osl     &lt;- e</span></span>

<span class="giallo-l"><span>    tox     &lt;- tools</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    twemoji</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    vdi     &lt;- v</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>  wlx &lt;- w</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You can see how a bunch of the directories took their previous name in some form, and either expanded it or collapsed it, making sure it's gibberish. <br />
<code>tools</code> is a common word -&gt; <code>tox</code> is shorter and not a real thing. <br />
<code>documents</code> is another word -&gt; <code>dls</code> is unique and nice to type in. <br />
<code>backup</code> may even genuinely be used as a directory name all over the place -&gt; <code>ack</code> now has a subdirectory named <code>tua</code> which is hilarious.</p>
<p>All of these directories I can now effortlessly zoxide to, <em>or</em> type in manually without complaining about it. I found a great balance.</p>
<p>A question you may have now is "how the hell will you remember all of these?" — that's why the naming stage is so important to take seriously. <br />
When creating a directory name, I let the purpose of the directory guide me into naming it naturally. <br />
Basically, <code>ork</code> <em>feels</em> correct to me to contain my forks, and so is easily memorable. <br />
<code>lai</code> is nonsense, but it looks beautiful to me; <em>that</em> is what makes it makes sense to me, for the purpose of storing <em>my</em> projects. <br />
Because <code>fes</code> used to be <code>int</code>, <code>foe</code> is now really memorable to hold “info” — the path <code>int/foe</code> is peak comedy to me. Similarly to <code>ack/tua</code>.</p>
<p>This is why I cannot give any specific suggestions to what <em>your</em> directory names should be; what feels correctest to <em>you</em> will be similarly heavily personalized. I hope I could inspire you to rethink your directory structure, to make it more <em>enjoyable</em> to traverse and look at.</p>

 The subdirectory <code>eli</code> comes from a pun based on the upper directory being named <code>int</code>. If I named a future project <code>gents</code>, I'd have a path <code>~/int/eli/gents</code>. Which is of course hilarious.</p>
