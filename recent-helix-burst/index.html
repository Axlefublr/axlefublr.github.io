				<p><a href="https://axlefublr.github.io/helix-master-vs-stable/">As you may know</a>, I maintain my own <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Axlefublr/helix">helix fork</a>. <br />
Recently I noticed a huuuuuuuge burst of new commits, and here's what new features I found!</p>
<h1 id="cd-improvement"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#cd-improvement" aria-label="Anchor link for: cd-improvement">cd improvement</a></h1>
<p>The <code>:change-current-directory</code> (<code>:cd</code>) command now more closely mimics the useful behavior of <code>cd</code> in the shell: <br />
With no arguments (<code>:cd</code>), it now changes directory to <code>~</code> (<code>$HOME</code>). <br />
<code>:cd -</code> changes directory to the most recent one. So, if you <code>:cd ~/Documents</code> and then <code>:cd ~/Downloads</code>, <code>:cd -</code> will put you back into <code>~/Documents</code>.</p>
<h1 id="auto-trim-trailing-whitespace-with-a-caveat"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#auto-trim-trailing-whitespace-with-a-caveat" aria-label="Anchor link for: auto-trim-trailing-whitespace-with-a-caveat">auto-trim trailing whitespace with a caveat</a></h1>
<p>The <code>insert_newline</code> action now trims that line's trailing whitespace.</p>
<p>So if you make custom mappings for <code>insert_newline</code>, or far more likely when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd> in insert mode, that line's trailing whitespace is automatically removed.</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="trim-trailing-whitespace.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>While this is cool to have and will fix most trailing whitespace moving forward, the issue is the <em>moving forward</em> part. <br />
Somehow we still don't have a <code>:trim</code> command or on-write hooks that would trim for us, so this on-newline behavior won't help you clean up a codebase ‚Äî only to not mess up (as much) when writing a new one.</p>
<h1 id="auto-continue-line-comments"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#auto-continue-line-comments" aria-label="Anchor link for: auto-continue-line-comments">auto-continue line comments</a></h1>
<p>Our second on-newline feature! Although this one doesn't depend on the <code>insert_newline</code> action, and will happen even if you use something like <kbd>o</kbd> / <kbd>O</kbd></p>
<video controls>
  <source src="extending-comments.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>This feature has actually been in core for about a month I think, but I didn't rush to rebase to get it because honestly I didn't want the feature. <br />
I used it back in neovim, and I found it to annoy me more often than help me. An extra <code>// </code> / <code># </code> / etc to type in is not as much effort as possibly having to <em>fix</em> them. <br />
Additionally, in neovim the operation felt very wonky visually.</p>
<p>The wonkiness is not an issue in helix, as this is a <em>core</em> feature, not something that was tacked on, so that's crossed out. <br />
However the "annoying" part may still remain, as after ~1 minute of fiddling with it, I found a bug¬π when you try to extend a comment upwards, when you're at the first line in the file:</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="weird-bug.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Interestingly, there is no option to disable this auto-comment-extending behavior.</p>
<p>¬π Around two days after publishing this blog post, the bug is fixed! <br />
This is surprisingly fast response speed for helix ‚Äî generally things move reeeeeaaaally slowly. <br />
This fills me with determination!</p>
<p>Additionally, there <em>is</em> now an option to disable this behavior ü•≥ <br />
Set <code>continue-comments</code> in the <code>[editor]</code> section to <code>false</code>, if you want to.</p>
<h1 id="path-completions"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#path-completions" aria-label="Anchor link for: path-completions">path completions</a></h1>
<p>Now you get autocomplete for filepaths! :D</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="filepath-completions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>If you were using my fork prior, you already had these! <br />
I've been following the PR that implements this feature for a month or two, and I had it merged into my fork. <br />
I'm quite surprised to see it get merged into core! So now that's one less responsibility on my fork.</p>
<p>But also, before this point, there was a bug where you could only complete a single filepath on a given line. If you tried to complete another path, the completions wouldn't show up. <br />
This is no longer an issue!</p>
<p>This feature is enabled by default, but if you wanted to disable it, set the <code>path-completion</code> option in the <code>[editor]</code> section to false.</p>
<h1 id="default-comment-token"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#default-comment-token" aria-label="Anchor link for: default-comment-token">default comment token</a></h1>
<p>For unrecognized languages (if you just open a file with no extension and no inferrable text, for example), the comment token used to be <code>//</code>. Now it is <code>#</code>. <br />
Makes sense, considering that more often than not, an unrecognized file is a config file that <em>probably</em> uses <code>#</code> for comments (if it even supports them).</p>
<h1 id="conf-language"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#conf-language" aria-label="Anchor link for: conf-language">conf "language"</a></h1>
<p>You might notice that the syntax highlighting for random <code>.conf</code> files is now gone. <br />
This happened because of a commit that (as it says in the commit message) ‚ÄúFix language configuration for .conf files‚Äù. <br />
‚ÄúFix‚Äù my ass.</p>

<p>If you use <code>paste</code> in insert mode, that makes an undo "checkpoint":</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="paste-checkpoint.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>I needed to press <kbd>u</kbd> three times there, to undo the second line. <br />
Previously, a single <kbd>u</kbd> would undo the whole line.</p>
<p>This is pretty great! It's somewhat often that I start typing in a line and then paste from my system clipboard, only to realize I pasted in the wrong thing. Now after I undo, I <em>don't</em> lose the extra text I typed in before the paste.</p>
<p>About clipboards...</p>
<h1 id="configurable-clipboard-providers"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#configurable-clipboard-providers" aria-label="Anchor link for: configurable-clipboard-providers">configurable clipboard providers</a></h1>
<p>Previously, helix figured them out automatically. <br />
Now, you have an option to set them explicitly.</p>

<p>Helix can be configured wither to use a builtin clipboard configuration or to use a provided command. <br />

<p>For custom commands the contents of the yank/paste is communicated over stdin/stdout.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes it really said ‚Äúwither‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course cool for the (I think unlikely?) situation if your clipboard provider didn't work, but what I find more interesting is the <em>custom</em> clipboard provider. <br />
As you see in the example they specify, you can straight up just use a random file. <br />
Interestingly, that's a hack to get your latest register to stay across helix sessions (unless helix deletes the file on exit, which would be mean).</p>
<p>If you use my fork though, you don't need to bother doing that, as I merge in a PR that adds persistence to various things, including your default register.</p>
<p>However: the "primary selection" (register <code>*</code>) is something that I never use, so I could potentially change it to give me fairly arbitrary behavior. <br />
I could easily write a script that would act as my <code>*</code> register, and do different things on paste / yank.</p>
<p>For the most part, actions like <code>shell_pipe</code>, <code>insert_output</code>, <code>append_ouput</code> along with command harps (my fork's feature) already provide you this "easily accessible script" behavior, but maybe you can come up with a strong enough contender that would make sense to put directly as the <code>*</code> register.</p>
<p>Share your ideas with me on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/axlefublr.bsky.social">bluesky</a> or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/bgVSg362dK">discord</a>, I would love to hear them.</p>
<h1 id="configurable-default-register"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#configurable-default-register" aria-label="Anchor link for: configurable-default-register">configurable default register</a></h1>
<p>The default register used to be just <code>"</code>. Used when you don't explicitly specify any other register.</p>
<p>But <em>now</em>, there's an option in the <code>[editor]</code> section called <code>default-yank-register</code> that you can set to override that.</p>
<p>Aside from path completion, I feel this is the biggest "fuck yes finally!" recent feature.</p>
<p>In neovim, there was some option (don't remember lol) to let you use your system clipboard as your default register. So if you set it, you could just <code>y</code> directly into the clipboard and <code>p</code> directly from the clipboard.</p>
<p>I used it, actually! And I loved it. <br />
And now, helix has it too ü•≥</p>
<p>However, unsurprisingly, it's <em>better</em> ‚Äî you aren't restricted to just set the <code>+</code>/<code>*</code> registers as your default ones, you can use whichever you want! <br />
It could be just <code>a</code>, or even the <code>/</code> register, terrifyingly: that would give you the behavior that all yanks set your current search.</p>
<p>Or remember that custom clipboard provider feature from the last section? Nobody is stopping you from combining these two features, and setting your default register to behave differently somehow. <br />
Default register set to <code>*</code>, and default provider for <code>*</code> is your custom script. ??? -&gt; profit.</p>
<p>Currently, <kbd>y</kbd>¬π yanks to default register for me, and <kbd>Y</kbd> to the system clipboard. It was more of a workaround than preferred solution, since now I'll just set <code>default-yank-register</code> to <code>+</code> to sync it to my clipboard, and I'll never need to worry about it again ü•≥</p>
<blockquote>
<p>¬π this is technically a lie, because it's <kbd>s</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> that are my yanking hotkeys (I hate pressing <kbd>y</kbd>), <br />
but the example would be less clear if I said it to begin with</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, the default register using your clipboard directly <em>may introduce overhead</em>. <br />
Meaning: some operations, especially when you yank / paste in bulk, may slow down; sometimes considerably. <br />
But I'm saying this from experience in <em>neovim</em>, and even then it was only noticeable in the most obscene of situations. <br />
So, it's something to consider, but not something to particularly worry about.</p>
<h1 id="word-bounded-autosearch"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#word-bounded-autosearch" aria-label="Anchor link for: word-bounded-autosearch">word-bounded autosearch</a></h1>
<p><kbd>*</kbd> lets you search for your selection. But it slightly changed!</p>
<p><em>Now</em> it places <code>\b</code> around the selection to only match it word-bounded. In other words, if you <kbd>*</kbd> on <code>word</code>, you will no longer match <code>wordword</code>.</p>
<p>The default behavior of <kbd>*</kbd> changed to the new action called <code>search_selection_detect_word_boundaries</code>. <br />
The <em>old</em> behavior is in the action called <code>search_selection</code> and can be accessed by pressing <kbd>alt+*</kbd>.</p>
<p>Arrest me: I was <em>just</em> booting up to complain that I don't like this new default behavior because <code>\b</code> doesn't work for non-word characters... <br />
But they thought of this!</p>
<p>If you select <code>*just*</code> and press <kbd>*</kbd>, it will search for <code>*just*</code>. <br />
If you select <code>just</code> and press <kbd>*</kbd>, it will search for <code>\bjust\b</code>.</p>
<p>So it's actually being smart about word boundaries, and only applies them when they would <em>work</em>. <br />
